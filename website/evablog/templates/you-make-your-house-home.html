            <p>Feeling cosy and totally comfortable at home is an absolute must for me. If I do not – I start being moody, moany and so on – you do not want to deal with me in that state of mind.</p>
            <p>When I first moved out of my parents’ house and into a student dorm I was stressed to say the least. During one day I moved to another city where I had no one, to the student dorm with poor conditions into the room which I had to share with two other girls who were complete strangers at the moment. I was overwhelmed and all I wanted to do was pack my stuff and go back to my bellowed home. But I did not.</p>
            <p>I spent half a year moaning and pitting myself, crying and trying to convince my parents to let me rent an apartment (by let I mean ‘give me money’), but they didn’t budge.

                    With this post I’ll start series of posts about interior inspirations (swooning over Pinterest & Instagram pictures) and what I do to get that much needed homey feeling in the apartment I’ve just moved into. So, hang on here and see what I’m up to. Hopefully I inspired or helped someone who knew smth was wrong, but didn’t realise what exactly. Please comment below if you have any tips or recommendations.
